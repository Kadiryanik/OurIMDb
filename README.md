For use this java codes you have to do somethings which i tell you.

First you need to download and setup mysql server
I use AppServ you can download it with this link: https://www.appserv.org/en/

Secondly you have to copy this JAR file which is in "mysql-connector-java-5.1.40" folder 
into the "C:\Wokplace" folder

All these are done! You are ready to go!
